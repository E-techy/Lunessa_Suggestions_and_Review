 * Fetch suggestions based on filter type, timestamp, and suggestion type.

 * @param {Object} options
 * @param {Date|string|number|null} [options.timestamp] - Reference timestamp for pagination.
 * @param {"latest"|"oldest"} options.filterType - Determines the sorting order and time-based filtering. Fetches suggestions before ("latest") or after ("oldest") the timestamp.
 * @param {"active"|"pending"} options.suggestionType - Determines the core filtering criteria for suggestions.
 * - "pending": Fetches suggestions where 'accepted' is false and status is 'pending'.
 * - "active": Fetches suggestions where 'accepted' is true and status is not 'completed' or 'live'.
 * @returns {Promise<{ success: boolean, suggestions?: Array<Object> }>} A promise that resolves to an object indicating success and containing the suggestions array.
